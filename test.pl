 ;; Question 1

 (: plSuffixContained : (Listof String) -> Any)

 ; Input - list of strings , Output - #f or the current suffix that founded.
 ; Recoursive function that implements by simple stop condition and first and last options that give us the recoursive iterative.
 ; In addition , the 'string-suffix' functionality help me to solve it easily.

 ; Functions like 'string-append' very useful here to decrease the code lines.
